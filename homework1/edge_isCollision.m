%function [flag]=edge_isCollision(vertices1,vertices2)
%Returns  true if the two edges intesect.  Note: if the two edges overlap but are
%colinear, or they overlap only at a single endpoint, they are not considered as
%intersecting (i.e., in these cases the function returns  false). If one of the
%two edges has zero length, the function should always return the result that
%edges are non-intersecting.

%The function should be able to handle any orientation of the edges (including
%both vertical and horizontal). Note that the ``overlap'' case needs to be
%checked up to floating-point precision.

% same, the line is considered zero length
