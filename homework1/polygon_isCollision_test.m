%function polygon_isCollision_test()
%This function is the same as polygon_isVisible_test, but instead of step 
%item:test-visibility, use the following: enumerate  whether each point in 
%testPointsWithPolygon is in collision with the polygon or not using
%polygon_isCollision.  each point in  testPointsWithPolygon in green if it is not
%in collision, and red otherwise. enumerate Moreover, increase the number of test
%points from $5$ to $100$ (i.e.,  testPoints should have dimension [ 2 $ $ 
%100]).
