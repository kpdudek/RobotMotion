%function twolink_planner_test(shape,repulsiveWeight,epsilon)
%This function performs the same steps as potential_planner_test in Questino 
%q:potentialPlannerTest, except for the following: itemize  step  it:grad-handle:
% @x   gradHandle should be set to  @x   @twolink_totalGrad.  step 
%it:grad-handle: Use the contents of the variable  @x   thetaStart instead of  @x
%  xStart to initialize the planner.  step  it:plot-plan: Use twolink_plot to
%plot the results of the planner (since the output  @x   xPath from
%potential_planner will really contain a sequence of join angles, rather than a
%sequence of 2-D points). itemize
