%function torus_twolink()
%For each one of the curves used in Question  q:torusDrawChartsTangents, do the
%following: itemize  torus_pushCurve to compute the array  thetaPoints for the
%curve;  twolink_draw to plot the two-link manipulator in each one of the
%configurations given by the columns of  thetaPoints. itemize The function should
%produce a total of four windows (or, alternatively, a single window with four
%subplots), each window (or subplot) showing all the configurations of the
%manipulator superimposed on each other.
